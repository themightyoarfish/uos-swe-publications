  abstract	= {For an identical topic, there are differences between
		  trainings in industry and lectures at universities. Among
		  other boundary conditions, they have diverse audiences and
		  goals. Nevertheless, for teaching the same topic, of
		  course, not everything is completely different. Therefore,
		  this paper discusses an approach for a shared concept for
		  teaching in universities and trainings in the industry. In
		  this approach, the parts of a course are divided into a
		  module-based structure. This enables to flexibly select
		  modules based on individual boundary conditions for
		  conducting a training/lecture. The industry and the
		  university can share the same repertoire of modules.
		  Furthermore, the industry benefits from up to date
		  knowledge about theories from universities. On the other
		  hand, universities benefit from experiences and practical
		  applications. An evaluation of this approach is conducted
		  on a case study based on teaching the Unified Modeling
		  Language (UML) both at the university lecture and an
		  industrial training.},

  abstract	= {Embedded software development is moving towards the
		  model-based paradigm to support the complexity of todayâ€™s
		  embedded systems, as they become more and more important
		  and omnipresent in our daily lives. In this context, the
		  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a widely used standard.
		  Code generators can be executed to generate source code
		  from UML models. Usually the code generators are
		  proprietary for one UML tool. If code generators for
		  different targets or programming languages have to be
		  supported by various modeling tools, the wheel must be
		  reinvented. Code generators could use the standardized
		  Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI)
		  format of the UML as a basis. However, tools export their
		  data to XMI differently. Therefore, the paper shows how the
		  proprietary models of UML tools can be mapped to a
		  standardized UML model. This is realized by using
		  techniques for model to model transformations. These
		  techniques need a meta-model for the source and the target
		  model. Hence, an approach is introduced for creating
		  meta-models for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
		  of UML-tools, which act as a facade. Then the code
		  generators can work with the standardized UML model to
		  generate the source code. This results in an improved
		  scalability of the code generators.},
