  abstract	= {UML activity diagrams can be used to model business
		  processes which are implemented in a software project. It
		  is a worthwhile goal to automatically transform at least
		  parts of UML diagrams into software. Automated code
		  generation reduces the total amount of errors in a software
		  project but the model itself can still violate specified
		  requirements. A quality improvement is the usage of a model
		  checker which searches through the whole state space of
		  model and checks whether all requirements are met. A model
		  checker requires a formal description of a model for a
		  complete verification. Activity diagrams often describe
		  processes informally which is difficult to verify with a
		  model checker. We therefore propose the transformation of
		  activity to statechart diagrams which allow a more detailed
		  and formal description. Several algorithms exist to map UML
		  statecharts into a model checker input language for a
		  successful formal verification. Afterwards, the model
		  checker searches through the whole state space of a
		  statechart and therefore has to store each state in memory.
		  UML statecharts can reach a high degree of complexity which
		  is problematic for a complete state space traversal because
		  the total amount of available memory is exhausted.
		  Accordingly, we present the domain specific language UDL
		  (UML Statechart Modeling Language) and a transformation
		  from UDL into the Spin model checker input language
		  Promela. UDL contains features for property preserving
		  abstraction which reduces the models state space and
		  therefore the memory consumption of a model checker.
		  Furthermore, we introduce an optimisation technique for the
		  transformation process from UDL to Promela which focuses on
		  a reduced model checker run-time. A case study with a
		  movement tracking system demonstrates how our approach
		  could significantly reduce the memory consumption of a
		  model checker and allows the verification of complex
		  models.},

		  Modularisation as a means to achieve separation of concerns
		  is a key concept in the development of complex software. A
		  fundamental goal is the independent specification of system
		  aspects and their subsequent integration. There have been
		  several novel approaches which try to find new dimensions
		  for separation of concerns beyond the "traditional"
		  concepts of module and class. For examples of such
		  "advanced separation of concerns" we cite Adaptive
		  Programming, Aspect-Oriented Programming, Composition
		  Filters, Hyperspaces, role modeling, Subject-Oriented
		  Programming, and so on. Recently such approaches have been
		  subsumed under the umbrella term Aspect-Oriented Software
		  Development (AOSD), whose themes, in addition to
		  programming language extensions, also encompass
		  enhancements of traditional analysis and design
		  methodologies. Such a new and emerging field has yet to
		  garner a uniform conception of its scope and a definition
		  of its central terms. After the success of the first
		  workshop by the GI on this topic, and in the run-up to the
		  1st International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software
		  Development (April, 23-26, 2002), the aim of this workshop
		  is again to provide room for fruitful discussions among
		  various academic and industrial working groups who are
		  involved with issues of aspect-oriented software
		  development and related themes. We have accepted 11 papers
		  for this year's workshop whose topics cover a broad range
		  from theoretical reasoning about aspect-oriented systems to
		  practical applications thereof. They are all included in
		  this technical report. },

  abstract	= {Business Process Management is a paradigm for enterprise
		  computing that uses IT not only to support or execute
		  business processes but also to continuously monitor and
		  improve these processes to better achieve business
		  objectives. A variant on Business Process Management,
		  called Semantic Business Process Management, is meant to
		  further close the gap between business and IT by attaching
		  business semantics to the technology artifacts used for
		  Business Process Management. A current problem in Semantic
		  Business Process Management is that the specification of
		  the business requirements that processes must respond to
		  and that follow from the enterprise's strategic decisions,
		  is not fully integrated within the design of the processes
		  themselves. In this paper, we propose an approach in which
		  business requirements for business processes are formally
		  modeled and the skeleton of the designs of these business
		  processes is automatically generated from these models. The
		  approach presented here focuses upon the modeling of
		  policies (i.e., a kind of business requirements for
		  business processes) and on the subsequent design of
		  business processes that comply to these policies. A first
		  contribution is extending an existing goal-oriented
		  requirements specification language, i.e. Formal Tropos, to
		  incorporate policies, called Policy-extended Formal Tropos.
		  A second contribution is offering an automated
		  transformation to create business process design skeletons
		  out of the Policy-extended Formal Tropos models. The paper
		  also reports upon three pilot studies that were conducted
		  as a first, though preliminary, empirical test of our
		  approach.},

		  verification. We describe the CASE model and explain how it
		  can be used to structure and model policies extracted from

		  sequences. Our choice is the model checking concept. In the
		  paper we present examples of business process models and
		  how these models may be checked. We introduce a model to
		  specify the rules (rules model) and demonstrate how the
		  results of the checks can be displayed in the business
		  process models. These models and the rules are represented
		  in a graphical editor. Both models are transformed into a
		  formal language which may be processed by a verification
		  tool - a model checker in our case. The results are then
		  visualized in the graphical editor indicating where the
		  model violates or keeps the rules.},

		  systems large scale e-commerce systems and their
		  interactions are hard to be validated or verified although
		  the quality requirements for these systems are very high.
		  The question is now: are there any further possibilities to
		  check these systems except doing this manually? An approach
		  is to focus on the models describing the systems; and
		  specifically to focus on the models of the behavior.
		  Although the verification of temporal aspects is much more
		  complex than checking static dependencies there is a
		  promising technology: model checking. Nevertheless we need
		  distinctive improvements before this technology can be
		  applied in the real system development. We need graphical
		  formal requirement notations for different kinds of process
		  model notations as representations of the specification of
		  rules. We must be able to present the results positive and
		  especially negative to the different types of stakeholders.
		  And finally the model checking technique has to be improved
		  in order to deal with different types of model elements
		  which are typical for business process models.},

		  systems has been gaining a lot of attention in the recent
		  past. It is imperative for a hard real-time embedded system
		  to execute and respond to sequenced exchanges of messages
		  under critical temporal constraints. The UML provides
		  artifacts such as communication diagrams, sequence diagrams
		  and timing diagrams to aid software engineers to model and
		  precisely document such a schedule of interactions or state

		  level is interesting on one hand, it is also significant to

		  A step forward in this direction is to provide a real-time
		  representation of the target system behavior on the host

		  on the host side with a monitor solution in the target
		  side. With the back annotated information from the target,

		  that the full implementation of the system can be generated

		  propose a declarative language for describing the behavior
		  of platform-independent models based on a hybrid notation
		  that uses graphical elements as well as textual elements in
		  the form of OCL code snippets. Compared to existing
		  approaches based on action languages it is situated at a
		  higher level of abstraction and, through a clean separation
		  of modifier operations and query operations, simplifies the

		  trainings in industry and lectures at universities. Among
		  other boundary conditions, they have diverse audiences and
		  goals. Nevertheless, for teaching the same topic, of
		  course, not everything is completely different. Therefore,
		  this paper discusses an approach for a shared concept for
		  teaching in universities and trainings in the industry. In
		  this approach, the parts of a course are divided into a
		  module-based structure. This enables to flexibly select
		  modules based on individual boundary conditions for
		  conducting a training/lecture. The industry and the
		  university can share the same repertoire of modules.
		  Furthermore, the industry benefits from up to date
		  knowledge about theories from universities. On the other
		  hand, universities benefit from experiences and practical
		  applications. An evaluation of this approach is conducted
		  on a case study based on teaching the Unified Modeling
		  Language (UML) both at the university lecture and an

  abstract	= {Embedded software engineering very often involves
		  development of complex, mission critical software; wherein
		  it is imperative that the developed software fulfills its
		  requirements to achieve high quality. In such cases, there
		  are several advantages of using specialized Requirements
		  Management (RM) tools for managing the requirements.
		  Critical timing requirements are among the foremost
		  non-functional (quality) requirements to be fulfilled by
		  increasingly complex embedded software. Further, a correct
		  and effective timing behavior is among the characteristics
		  of high-quality software. On the other hand, Model-Driven
		  Development (MDD) is considered as the next paradigm shift
		  to address the increasing complexity in embedded software
		  development and to achieve high-quality standards.
		  Similarly, there are specialized tools for validating and
		  analyzing the timing behavior of the embedded software.
		  However, such tools are used very late in the development
		  process, when the actual timing errors occur. Thus, it is
		  intuitive to perceive that an integrated model-based
		  framework encompassing a complete workflow from
		  specification until validation of timing requirements in
		  embedded software systems is very beneficial for
		  high-quality software development, nevertheless is still
		  missing. Addressing the aforementioned gap, this paper
		  proposes an approach toward a complete workflow for
		  managing timing requirements in RM tools, specifying timing
		  behavior in MDD tools and their validation in specialized
		  tools for timing analyses. A prototype implementation of
		  the proposed framework and its experimental evaluation are
		  discussed.},

		  model-based paradigm to support the complexity of today’s
		  embedded systems, as they become more and more important
		  and omnipresent in our daily lives. In this context, the
		  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a widely used standard.
		  Code generators can be executed to generate source code
		  from UML models. Usually the code generators are
		  proprietary for one UML tool. If code generators for
		  different targets or programming languages have to be
		  supported by various modeling tools, the wheel must be
		  reinvented. Code generators could use the standardized
		  Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI)
		  format of the UML as a basis. However, tools export their
		  data to XMI differently. Therefore, the paper shows how the
		  proprietary models of UML tools can be mapped to a
		  standardized UML model. This is realized by using
		  techniques for model to model transformations. These
		  techniques need a meta-model for the source and the target
		  model. Hence, an approach is introduced for creating
		  meta-models for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
		  of UML-tools, which act as a facade. Then the code
		  generators can work with the standardized UML model to
		  generate the source code. This results in an improved

		  development. Tool support is essential for checking the
		  system quality efficiently. This is particularly true with
		  respect to the dynamic interactions of the processes within
		  a system. A first generation of checkers - model checkers -
		  provide a basic technology for the verification of
		  process-based systems. Conventional model checkers bear two
		  drawbacks concerning mainly their user-friendliness which
		  impede their broad application. First, model checkers in
		  general do not support the graphical representation of
		  rules (specifications). Although a model may be described
		  with a graphical notation the specification which has to be
		  checked against the model is generally still text-based.
		  This makes the usage of the checker difficult for process
		  modeling experts. Second, the expressiveness concerning the
		  verification model semantics to be checked is limited to
		  states which are connected by transitions. However, many
		  system development models (e.g. the business process model
		  we use as example) embrace more element types. These are
		  unsupported by the conventional model checkers resulting in
		  a loss of verification precision. The checking system we
		  present in this paper integrates both novelties: the
		  graphical notation for a user-friendly specification and an
		  extended specification language together with a
		  corresponding verifier which supports the checking of many
		  different types of elements (although the paper presents
		  the approach with only two types). The integration is
		  realized by an XML-based transformation system which links
		  the graphical editor to the checking tool.},

		  well-known observation that the knowledge about

		  objects but cross-cuts many objects. Such cross-cutting
		  concerns are effectively addressed by applying the
		  separation of concerns principle. We have, therefore,
		  employed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to build

		  discuss our aspect-oriented approach both for the
		  horizontal (i.e. the collaborations) and vertical (i.e. the

		  implementations are based on AspectJ0.4beta7 from Xerox

		  the requirements are actually fulfilled in the design and
		  implementation. The increasing demand for compliancy to
		  requirements (e.g. due to laws) together with the
		  increasing system complexity re-attracts notice to

		  and verification-oriented models (typically just simple
		  structures like finite state automata) on the other hand.
		  This is approached by extending the verification model in a
		  controlled manner towards more semantics resulting in our
		  extended Kripke structure. To profit from such a semantic

		  model-driven development) is a considerable improvement of
		  the software development. However, besides the automated
		  generation the verification of these generated systems
		  needs to be supported, too. By applying generators it is
		  not necessarily guaranteed that the generation outcome is
		  correct. Typical problems may be, firstly, the use of a
		  wrong operator resulting in an erroneous generation (static
		  aspects of the generation). Secondly, the interactions
		  between the different generated system assets (snippets) of
		  the generated outcome might be incorrect, since the
		  snippets might be connected in a wrong sequence (dynamic
		  aspect of the generation). Therefore, the hierarchical
		  dependencies of the snippets which are the input of the
		  generator as well as the dynamic behavior resulting from
		  the generation have to be checked. We describe the
		  hierarchy in a version model based on Boolean logic. The
		  temporal behavior may be checked by model checkers. For the
		  generation we apply our XOpT concept which provides
		  domain-specific transformation operators on the XML
		  representation. Besides the principles of the static and
		  dynamic elements of our checking approach the paper
		  presents the way to map program assets to the version model
		  and to finite state automata which are the prerequisite for
		  the checking. Though the proposed checking is presented at
		  the code level the approach may be applied to different
		  kinds of assets, e.g. also on the model level.},

		  offers both the required and promised features / behavior.
		  In this paper we present an approach to describe the
		  components' features and dynamic behavior as finite state
		  machines which may automatically be verified by model
		  checkers. The model of the component is derived from the
		  code providing consistency between documentation and
		  implementation. The models of several components may be
		  combined to larger systems (according to the composition of
		  the real code components). To deal with the state explosion
		  problem, our approach allows to "abstract" of the complete

		  In the beginning of a reuse-based system development the
		  requirements are modeled similarly as the reusable code
		  assets. Model checking can be employed to determine the
		  consistency between these requirement models and the models
		  of the complete systems, subsystems or components. The tool
		  support eases incremental system development and rapid
		  prototyping / checking. The impact of a composed component
		  (the component's model respectively) may be instantly
		  examined (against the modeled requirements).}
