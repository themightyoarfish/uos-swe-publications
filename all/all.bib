    abstract = "UML activity diagrams can be used to model business processes which are implemented in a software project. It is a worthwhile goal to automatically transform at least parts of UML diagrams into software. Automated code generation reduces the total amount of errors in a software project but the model itself can still violate specified requirements. A quality improvement is the usage of a model checker which searches through the whole state space of model and checks whether all requirements are met. A model checker requires a formal description of a model for a complete verification. Activity diagrams often describe processes informally which is difficult to verify with a model checker. We therefore propose the transformation of activity to statechart diagrams which allow a more detailed and formal description. Several algorithms exist to map UML statecharts into a model checker input language for a successful formal verification. Afterwards, the model checker searches through the whole state space of a statechart and therefore has to store each state in memory. UML statecharts can reach a high degree of complexity which is problematic for a complete state space traversal because the total amount of available memory is exhausted. Accordingly, we present the domain specific language UDL (UML Statechart Modeling Language) and a transformation from UDL into the Spin model checker input language Promela. UDL contains features for property preserving abstraction which reduces the models state space and therefore the memory consumption of a model checker. Furthermore, we introduce an optimisation technique for the transformation process from UDL to Promela which focuses on a reduced model checker run-time. A case study with a movement tracking system demonstrates how our approach could significantly reduce the memory consumption of a model checker and allows the verification of complex models.",

The Workshop web page may be found at URL: http://www.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/\textasciitilde pulvermu/workshops/aosd2002/ Modularisation as a means to achieve separation of concerns is a key concept in the development of complex software. A fundamental goal is the independent specification of system aspects and their subsequent integration. There have been several novel approaches which try to find new dimensions for separation of concerns beyond the "traditional" concepts of module and class. For examples of such "advanced separation of concerns" we cite Adaptive Programming, Aspect-Oriented Programming, Composition Filters, Hyperspaces, role modeling, Subject-Oriented Programming, and so on. Recently such approaches have been subsumed under the umbrella term Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), whose themes, in addition to programming language extensions, also encompass enhancements of traditional analysis and design methodologies. Such a new and emerging field has yet to garner a uniform conception of its scope and a definition of its central terms. After the success of the first workshop by the GI on this topic, and in the run-up to the 1st International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development (April, 23-26, 2002), the aim of this workshop is again to provide room for fruitful discussions among various academic and industrial working groups who are involved with issues of aspect-oriented software development and related themes. We have accepted 11 papers for this year's workshop whose topics cover a broad range from theoretical reasoning about aspect-oriented systems to practical applications thereof. They are all included in this technical report.},

    abstract = "Business Process Management is a paradigm for enterprise computing that uses IT not only to support or execute business processes but also to continuously monitor and improve these processes to better achieve business objectives. A variant on Business Process Management, called Semantic Business Process Management, is meant to further close the gap between business and IT by attaching business semantics to the technology artifacts used for Business Process Management. A current problem in Semantic Business Process Management is that the specification of the business requirements that processes must respond to and that follow from the enterprise's strategic decisions, is not fully integrated within the design of the processes themselves. In this paper, we propose an approach in which business requirements for business processes are formally modeled and the skeleton of the designs of these business processes is automatically generated from these models. The approach presented here focuses upon the modeling of policies (i.e., a kind of business requirements for business processes) and on the subsequent design of business processes that comply to these policies. A first contribution is extending an existing goal-oriented requirements specification language, i.e. Formal Tropos, to incorporate policies, called Policy-extended Formal Tropos. A second contribution is offering an automated transformation to create business process design skeletons out of the Policy-extended Formal Tropos models. The paper also reports upon three pilot studies that were conducted as a first, though preliminary, empirical test of our approach.",

In the discipline of business process management in particular, compliance is considered as an important driver of the efficiency, reliability and market value of companies. It consists of ensuring that enterprise systems behave according to some guidance provided in the form of regulations. This paper gives a definition of the research problem of regulatory compliance. We show why we expect a formal policy-based and model-driven approach to provide significant advantages in allowing enterprises to flexibly manage decision-making related to regulatory compliance. For this purpose, we contribute CoReL, a domain-specific modeling language for representing compliance requirements that has a graphical concrete syntax. Informal semantics of CoReL are introduced and its use is illustrated on an example. CoReL allows to leverage business process compliance modeling and checking, enhancing it with regard to, among other dimensions, user-friendliness, genericity, and traceability.",

Growing up from the first process re-engineering initiatives in the 1980's, BPM technologies now seek to span all of the organizational silos of enterprises, and also expand vertically from the strategy layers where visions and goals are defined to the lower data transaction layers. Ensuring the compliance of processes to the guidance and control provided to the business by regulations is an obligation to every enterprise. In this work, we motivate the need for automation in compliance management and propose the use of policies as a modeling concept for regulations. We introduce the CASE model for structuring regulatory compliance requirements as policies. Policies shall allow to model regulations at abstraction levels adequate to implementing platform independent mechanisms for policy verification. We describe the CASE model and explain how it can be used to structure and model policies extracted from regulations. This chapter also defines a policy modeling ontology that we propose as a language for formally modeling CASE policies. The basic CASE model and the corresponding policy modeling ontology support compliance of enterprise processes to regulations by enabling automation to compliance checking (verification). The utilization of the CASE method as well as the policy ontology is showcased using an example of resource access control in business processes.",

This concern is particularly relevant in the context of business process management (BPM) as this paradigm is getting adopted more widely for designing and building IT systems. Enforcing contractual compliance needs to be modeled at different levels of a BPM framework, which also includes the service layer. In this paper, we discuss requirements and methods for modeling contractual compliance for a SOA-supported BPM. We also show how business rule management integrated into an industry BPM tool allows modeling and processing functional and non-functional-property constraints which may be extracted from business process contracts. This work proposes a framework that responds to the requirements identified and proposes an architecture implementing it. Our approach is also illustrated by an example.",

Ensuring the compliance of processes to legal regulations, governance guidelines, and strategic business requirements is a sine qua non condition to controlling business behavior.

In this work, we motivate the need for automation in compliance management and introduce the role of policies. We then distinguish eight requirements for a compliance management framework. We also discuss different ways of conducting compliance checking. Finally, we propose a policy-based framework for business process compliance management. We eventually proceed to a discussion of the soundness and practicability of our approach, followed by an investigation of the main challenges ahead of our approach to policy-based semantic business process compliance management.",

Whereas the static relations in a system may be expressed by Boolean logic, the dynamic activities and their temporal sequences ask for a better formalism, e.g. temporal logic. Temporal logic is based on Boolean logic extended by operators expressing the temporal order of states. In general there are different technologies to verify temporal sequences. Our choice is the model checking concept. In the paper we present examples of business process models and how these models may be checked. We introduce a model to specify the rules (rules model) and demonstrate how the results of the checks can be displayed in the business process models. These models and the rules are represented in a graphical editor. Both models are transformed into a formal language which may be processed by a verification tool - a model checker in our case. The results are then visualized in the graphical editor indicating where the model violates or keeps the rules.",

The question is now: are there any further possibilities to check these systems except doing this manually? An approach is to focus on the models describing the systems; and specifically to focus on the models of the behavior. Although the verification of temporal aspects is much more complex than checking static dependencies there is a promising technology: model checking. Nevertheless we need distinctive improvements before this technology can be applied in the real system development. We need graphical formal requirement notations for different kinds of process model notations as representations of the specification of rules. We must be able to present the results positive and especially negative to the different types of stakeholders. And finally the model checking technique has to be improved in order to deal with different types of model elements which are typical for business process models.",

As a result, transformations between XML documents become more and more important.

Only in this case, the domain knowledge is explicitly available and not hidden into, e. g., Java or XSLT code. Consequently, domain experts can easier understand, validate, and modify the transformation themselves. This paper presents a generic composition concept that relies on transformation itself. It allows the definition of transformation operator hierarchies containing different levels of transformation operators, e. g. domain-independent and domain-specific ones. We apply the proposed operator hierarchy concept to XSLT, and build new complex operators on top of existing ones which are specifically suited to develop transformations in a certain application area.",

It describes the static structure using a modified UML class diagram that separates query operations from modifier operations. The former are defined in the class diagram via OCL constraints, while the latter are defined using a MOF-based metamodel that contains modifier operations and properties as first-class entities and augments them with associations and OCL expressions.

Systems including a metaclass concept are either only implicitly supporting the management of meta information or explicitly giving unrestricted access to manipulate metaclasses which can result in inconsistent states of the system. To make the explicit support more system-controlled, we use a partition of the meta scheme into two parts: the system view and the application view. We describe possible schema level operations and their effect on metaclasses. It is shown how object-oriented concepts like methods and their implementations can be managed as a special kind of meta information. Additionally, a simple extension to the query algebra of the underlying object-oriented database system is presented that allows users to query objects and meta objects within a single algebra expression.",

There is also a lack of usage of corresponding modeling languages for the MDD and MBT phases. In this context, this paper discusses the applicability of an integrated model-based approach and test framework which addresses the aforementioned gaps. The approach is evaluated in a spark extinguishing embedded system example based on a real-life embedded software engineering project.

However, deploying/executing these test cases in the embedded target without affecting the real-time behavior of the system still remains a challenging and unanswered question. To address this, we propose a novel architecture to perform an integrated model based testing for embedded systems. We introduce a holistic model based design, development and testing approach with the aid of a monitor and target debugger solution for real-time embedded systems. Our proposed approach eliminates the need for dynamic source code instrumentation inserted into the target to execute the software test routines. This will result in preserving the real-time behavior which is a boon especially for real-time critical and code size constrained embedded systems. We illustrate our proposed approach with a prototype and an example.",

This is especially true for the industry standard MDD-based tools. In addition, a model-based debugging technique or tool chain based on the newly introduced timing diagrams in UML 2.x is not yet available. In this paper, we discuss a model-based, design-level debugging approach with which the timing behavior of embedded targets is visualized with the aid of UML timing diagrams on the host side, in real-time. The proposed approach is suitable for memory size constrained, real-time embedded target systems as the overhead introduced is negligible, constant and known beforehand. Hence, the end-user has the option to include the overhead in the system design phase, thereby making use of a model-based debug solution and at the same time adhering to temporal constraints. A prototype implementation of the proposed approach is discussed and an illustrative example is presented.",

It is imperative for a hard real-time embedded system to execute and respond to sequenced exchanges of messages under critical temporal constraints. The UML provides artifacts such as communication diagrams, sequence diagrams and timing diagrams to aid software engineers to model and precisely document such a schedule of interactions or state changes at the design level. While modeling at the design level is interesting on one hand, it is also significant to understand the run time behavior of the embedded software. A step forward in this direction is to provide a real-time representation of the target system behavior on the host side. We propose an approach to realize a target debugger on the host side with a monitor solution in the target side. With the back annotated information from the target, a visual representation of the system behavior in real-time is now available at the design level. This way, a debugging solution in real-time is provided, thus taking a step forward towards understanding the behavior of the embedded software at hand. We illustrate our proposed approach with a prototype and examples.",

We propose a declarative language for describing the behavior of platform-independent models based on a hybrid notation that uses graphical elements as well as textual elements in the form of OCL code snippets. Compared to existing approaches based on action languages it is situated at a higher level of abstraction and, through a clean separation of modifier operations and query operations, simplifies the comprehension of the behavioral aspects of the platform-independent system.",

Cross-cutting code is captured and localised in these aspects. Some of the cross-cutting features which are expressed in aspects cannot be woven with other features into the same application since two features could be mutually exclusive. With a growing number of aspects, manual control of these dependencies becomes error-prone or even impossible.

Therefore, a methodology to enrich service descriptions for (semi-) automated test derivation and the required IoT specific adaptations are shown. These descriptions are used to generate customised test data and to achieve full parameter combination coverage.

Therefore, this paper discusses an approach for a shared concept for teaching in universities and trainings in the industry. In this approach, the parts of a course are divided into a module-based structure. This enables to flexibly select modules based on individual boundary conditions for conducting a training/lecture. The industry and the university can share the same repertoire of modules. Furthermore, the industry benefits from up to date knowledge about theories from universities. On the other hand, universities benefit from experiences and practical applications. An evaluation of this approach is conducted on a case study based on teaching the Unified Modeling Language (UML) both at the university lecture and an industrial training.",

    abstract = "Embedded software engineering very often involves development of complex, mission critical software; wherein it is imperative that the developed software fulfills its requirements to achieve high quality. In such cases, there are several advantages of using specialized Requirements Management (RM) tools for managing the requirements. Critical timing requirements are among the foremost non-functional (quality) requirements to be fulfilled by increasingly complex embedded software. Further, a correct and effective timing behavior is among the characteristics of high-quality software. On the other hand, Model-Driven Development (MDD) is considered as the next paradigm shift to address the increasing complexity in embedded software development and to achieve high-quality standards. Similarly, there are specialized tools for validating and analyzing the timing behavior of the embedded software. However, such tools are used very late in the development process, when the actual timing errors occur. Thus, it is intuitive to perceive that an integrated model-based framework encompassing a complete workflow from specification until validation of timing requirements in embedded software systems is very beneficial for high-quality software development, nevertheless is still missing. Addressing the aforementioned gap, this paper proposes an approach toward a complete workflow for managing timing requirements in RM tools, specifying timing behavior in MDD tools and their validation in specialized tools for timing analyses. A prototype implementation of the proposed framework and its experimental evaluation are discussed.",

    abstract = "Embedded software development is moving towards the model-based paradigm to support the complexity of today‚Äôs embedded systems, as they become more and more important and omnipresent in our daily lives. In this context, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a widely used standard. Code generators can be executed to generate source code from UML models. Usually the code generators are proprietary for one UML tool. If code generators for different targets or programming languages have to be supported by various modeling tools, the wheel must be reinvented. Code generators could use the standardized Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI) format of the UML as a basis. However, tools export their data to XMI differently. Therefore, the paper shows how the proprietary models of UML tools can be mapped to a standardized UML model. This is realized by using techniques for model to model transformations. These techniques need a meta-model for the source and the target model. Hence, an approach is introduced for creating meta-models for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of UML-tools, which act as a facade. Then the code generators can work with the standardized UML model to generate the source code. This results in an improved scalability of the code generators.",

The Workshop has been held in Grenoble, France on April 7th, 2001, as a satellite event of ETAPS 2002. The aim of the SC Workshop is to collect different approaches and experiences in the domain of software composition. Component-based approaches to produce software from smaller units attract increasing attention of both research and industry. The rational behind this trend is in the promise of reuse. This is the idea to produce software by "plug \\& play" components which already exist or are produced by different external vendors. Components and software composition are considered to be a new way to overcome the remaining problems (e.g. reusability, deal with complexity) still not solved by the object-oriented paradigm. In this context, the SC workshop collects different approaches and experiences to explore and overcome the gap between promise and reality. The goal is to demystify these new approaches based on components and instead elaborate the real advantages, problems and challenges.},

    abstract = "System quality is a key issue in modern systems development. Tool support is essential for checking the system quality efficiently. This is particularly true with respect to the dynamic interactions of the processes within a system. A first generation of checkers - model checkers - provide a basic technology for the verification of process-based systems. Conventional model checkers bear two drawbacks concerning mainly their user-friendliness which impede their broad application. First, model checkers in general do not support the graphical representation of rules (specifications). Although a model may be described with a graphical notation the specification which has to be checked against the model is generally still text-based. This makes the usage of the checker difficult for process modeling experts. Second, the expressiveness concerning the verification model semantics to be checked is limited to states which are connected by transitions. However, many system development models (e.g. the business process model we use as example) embrace more element types. These are unsupported by the conventional model checkers resulting in a loss of verification precision. The checking system we present in this paper integrates both novelties: the graphical notation for a user-friendly specification and an extended specification language together with a corresponding verifier which supports the checking of many different types of elements (although the paper presents the approach with only two types). The integration is realized by an XML-based transformation system which links the graphical editor to the checking tool.",

Components are reusable building blocks for larger systems consisting of units (code pieces) and their construction plan.

However, components still have the problem of both unavailable and unreliable documentation of their properties. Moreover, a lack of validation support concerning the components' or composed systems' behavior may be observed. In other words, there is a lot of knowledge about how to combine components technically but less experience to validate the interactions between the components. In this paper we introduce an approach to model components and their compositions as a base for automatic validation techniques to check the components composition and their interactions. The validation aims at deriving the component models from the implementation which allows comparing the specifications with the real components code.",

However, this new checking ability results in a comparatively large number of rules representing requirements. But without a comprehensible representation of the relations between the rules on the one hand its hard to keep track on the validated rules and on the other hand to correctly interpret the validation results. In this paper we propose an improvement for the automated validation of business process models by offering elements to create abstract rules and arranging these rules in hierarchies. Top-down and bottom-up testing are supported by stepwise activating (and validating) the rules starting from the top of the hierarchy (or bottom respectively). Moreover, the rule hierarchies may be reused when similar systems are to be validated by configuring a valid rule sub-set for the specific business process system.",

In this paper we introduce a new approach to realise a collaboration-based design. Our approach is based on the well-known observation that the knowledge about inter-object collaborations cannot be localised within objects but cross-cuts many objects. Such cross-cutting concerns are effectively addressed by applying the separation of concerns principle. We have, therefore, employed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to build collaboration-based designs. In the paper we illustrate and discuss our aspect-oriented approach both for the horizontal (i.e. the collaborations) and vertical (i.e. the refinements) dimensions. Although the example implementations are based on AspectJ0.4beta7 from Xerox PARC, the approach is generic enough to be implemented using other AOP techniques.",

Many kinds of (business) rules, best practices, patterns, legal regulations may serve as specifications which the models have to fulfill. An already established technique to validate models of dynamic activities is model checking. In model checking the requirements are expressed by temporal logic. Temporal logic allows describing temporal dependencies. The models to be verified by model checkers are automata. In this context the question is how to transform process or workflow models into automata and how to specify the temporal logic in the way that the semantic of the process models is considered sufficiently. In our paper we present three approaches to transform process models to checkable automata. We use the example of ARIS Event-driven Process Chains. In particular, the third approach introduces specializers enabling semantic-rich requirement specifications. This reduces the gap between process models (consisting of different model element types) and verification models.",

These are either generic or specifically suited for (and thus also restricted to) a certain domain. New operators may be added on top of existing ones on demand. XOpT is a unification of composition and weaving techniques as it operates on the standardized XML data format. Furthermore, this language independence allows the manipulations on different abstraction levels in parallel preserving model consistency.

However, it is often neglected to verify that the requirements are actually fulfilled in the design and implementation. The increasing demand for compliancy to requirements (e.g. due to laws) together with the increasing system complexity re-attracts notice to automatic verification technologies for that purpose. The low user-friendliness and, thus, the low applicability of the verification technologies often prevents their employment. In this paper we aim at closing the gap between software development models with their rich notation and semantics (e.g. Event Process Chains, EPCs) on the one hand and verification-oriented models (typically just simple structures like finite state automata) on the other hand. This is approached by extending the verification model in a controlled manner towards more semantics resulting in our extended Kripke structure. To profit from such a semantic extension we, in addition, extend the temporal logic language CTL. Our new temporal logic language allows to express the expected requirements more precisely.",

This is because changes to the instance adaptation strategy or an attempt to adopt an entirely different strategy would be very costly. This paper proposes a flexible instance adaptation approach for systems employing class versioning to manage evolution. Flexibility is achieved by encapsulating the instance adaptation code in aspects - abstractions introduced by aspect-oriented programming to localise cross-cutting concerns. This makes it possible to make cost-effective changes to the instance adaptation strategy. The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by using two instance adaptation strategies: error handlers and update/backdate methods.",

Current solutions for testbeds, involving physical or virtual IoT resources, appear to require intense capacities for time and resources.

Temporal logic in general is a suitable formalism to express rules for dynamic processes. CTL is one kind of temporal logic focusing on branches and paths in particular. With CTL it is possible to formulate rules about different paths in business processes. Since the textual formulae of CTL are not very suitable in the development of commercial systems we introduce a graphical notation (G-CTL) based on the business process notation ARIS EPC.

We apply the component model based on the interface description with InPorts and OutPorts which allow a rather detailed definition of the components interaction. Moreover we take the term feature to name the core requirements to a component. Features are used to drive the description of the component composition which is regarded as an combination of features expressed by logical operators. Moreover the InPorts and OutPorts describe the dynamic component interactions. The combination of OutPorts and InPorts according to the component composition rules allows to reason about the component system's dynamic behavior.",

However, besides the automated generation the verification of these generated systems needs to be supported, too. By applying generators it is not necessarily guaranteed that the generation outcome is correct. Typical problems may be, firstly, the use of a wrong operator resulting in an erroneous generation (static aspects of the generation). Secondly, the interactions between the different generated system assets (snippets) of the generated outcome might be incorrect, since the snippets might be connected in a wrong sequence (dynamic aspect of the generation). Therefore, the hierarchical dependencies of the snippets which are the input of the generator as well as the dynamic behavior resulting from the generation have to be checked. We describe the hierarchy in a version model based on Boolean logic. The temporal behavior may be checked by model checkers. For the generation we apply our XOpT concept which provides domain-specific transformation operators on the XML representation. Besides the principles of the static and dynamic elements of our checking approach the paper presents the way to map program assets to the version model and to finite state automata which are the prerequisite for the checking. Though the proposed checking is presented at the code level the approach may be applied to different kinds of assets, e.g. also on the model level.",

    abstract = {Software reuse usually has the drawback that the documentation of the software units is rather incomplete and inaccurate. It is hard to verify that such a component offers both the required and promised features / behavior. In this paper we present an approach to describe the components' features and dynamic behavior as finite state machines which may automatically be verified by model checkers. The model of the component is derived from the code providing consistency between documentation and implementation. The models of several components may be combined to larger systems (according to the composition of the real code components). To deal with the state explosion problem, our approach allows to "abstract" of the complete component's behavior as needed (compression and inflation). In the beginning of a reuse-based system development the requirements are modeled similarly as the reusable code assets. Model checking can be employed to determine the consistency between these requirement models and the models of the complete systems, subsystems or components. The tool support eases incremental system development and rapid prototyping / checking. The impact of a composed component (the component's model respectively) may be instantly examined (against the modeled requirements).},

    abstract = "There are numerous concepts and tools for modeling business processes and several academic approaches to verify business processes. However, most modeling tools don‚Äôt integrate the checking of the processes. The three-tier architecture of the Business Application Modeler (BAM) provides the graphical representation of business models and rules (presentation layer) as well as integrates a veriÔ¨Åcation mechanism layer with an intermediate transformation layer. The hierarchical architecture allows to extend the checking system with additional features supporting the use of the veriÔ¨Åer in an industrial environment of commercial information system development. Examples for such add-ons are the improved graphical rule notation and an enhanced functionality of the veriÔ¨Åcation system supporting the expressiveness in the business modeling domain.",
