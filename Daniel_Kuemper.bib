  abstract	= {Abstract—Efficient testing of Internet of Things
		  (IoT)-based services suffers from the underlying
		  heterogeneous nature of IoT resources and hinders the
		  process of rapid service creation and deployment. Real
		  world effects, based on the behaviour of IoT-based
		  services, tend to prevent the straight forward execution
		  within the productive environment. Current solutions for
		  testbeds, involving physical or virtual IoT resources,
		  appear to require intense capacities for time and
		  resources. This paper describes a new approach for testing
		  IoT-based service build on a code insertion methodology,
		  which can be derived from the semantic description of the
		  IoT-based service. The proposed IoT resource emulation
		  interface is described from the semantic, architectural and
		  implementation perspective. The paper com- pares its
		  applicability and efficiency with classical approaches and
		  expose high emulation capabilities while minimising the
		  testing effort.}

		  overcome current silo architectures, we propose a business

		  Explicit description of services as well as the target
