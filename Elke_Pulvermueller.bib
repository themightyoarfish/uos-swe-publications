superseding traditional ways of developing embedded software in 
the recent decade. In line with the MDD, debugging Real-Time 
Embedded Software Systems (RTESS) and visualizing their behavior 
using models such as UML diagrams is becoming a reality. However, 
the existing MDD based debugging tools for RTESS are not applicable 
(require significant source code instrumentation, sophisticated 
debug interfaces, etc) for memory-size constrained RTESS. To address 
this, we discuss a model-based debugging methodology for RTESS which 
aims at overcoming the aforementioned limitations. Using our approach, 
the target behavior can be visualized in real-time using UML sequence 
and timing diagrams. We illustrate our approach with a prototype and 
examples. Performance metrics such as the target monitor size and the 
instrumentation overhead are discussed.},

business process models. There are different notations and formalism to 
express business processes. Many of these notations such as BPMN or 
ARIS EPC models are widely used in commercial projects.
In the paper we focus on formalisms to express rules and speciﬁcations 
for the business processes. Temporal logic in general is a suitable 
formalism to express rules for dynamic processes. CTL is one kind of 
temporal logic focusing on branches and paths in particular. With CTL 
it is possible to formulate rules about different paths in business 
processes. Since the textual formulae of CTL are not very suitable in 
the development of commercial systems we introduce a graphical 
notation (G-CTL) based on the business process notation ARIS EPC. 
Moreover, we add to the CTL semantics specializers to differentiate 
between the element types in business process models and provide 
wildcards which allow the user to check for unknown elements or 
elements with only partially known properties.},

   abstract    = {Components have been introduced in order to support 
software reuse. Components are reusable building blocks for larger 
systems consisting of units (code pieces) and their construction plan. 
Technologies like COM+, .Net, CORBA JavaBeans and EJBs (or web services 
which may be considered as web-based components) have been developed to 
support the component concept. However, components still have the problem 
of both unavailable and unreliable documentation of their properties. 
Moreover, a lack of validation support concerning the components' or 
composed systems' behavior may be observed. In other words, there is a 
lot of knowledge about how to combine components technically but less 
experience to validate the interactions between the components.
In this paper we introduce an approach to model components and their 
compositions as a base for automatic validation techniques to check the 
components composition and their interactions. The validation aims at 
deriving the component models from the implementation which allows 
comparing the specifications with the real components code.},

as one of the main challenges still to be efficiently dealt with in 
information systems. In the discipline of business process management in 
particular, compliance is considered as an important driver of the 
efficiency, reliability and market value of companies. It consists of 
ensuring that enterprise systems behave according to some guidance 
provided in the form of regulations. This paper gives a definition of 
the research problem of regulatory compliance. We show why we expect a 
formal policy-based and model-driven approach to provide significant 
advantages in allowing enterprises to flexibly manage decision-making 
related to regulatory compliance. For this purpose, we contribute CoReL, 
a domain-specific modeling language for representing compliance 
requirements that has a graphical concrete syntax. Informal semantics 
of CoReL are introduced and its use is illustrated on an example. CoReL 
allows to leverage business process compliance modeling and checking, 
enhancing it with regard to, among other dimensions, user-friendliness, 
genericity, and traceability.},

MDD-based tools. In addition, a model-based debugging technique or tool 
chain based on the newly introduced timing diagrams in UML 2.x is not 
yet available. In this paper, we discuss a model-based, design-level 
debugging approach with which the timing behavior of embedded targets 
is visualized with the aid of UML timing diagrams on the host side, 
in real-time. The proposed approach is suitable for memory size 
constrained, real-time embedded target systems as the overhead 
introduced is negligible, constant and known beforehand. Hence, the 
end-user has the option to include the overhead in the system design 
phase, thereby making use of a model-based debug solution and at the 
same time adhering to temporal constraints. A prototype implementation 
of the proposed approach is discussed and an illustrative example is

   abstract  = {UML activity diagrams can be used to model business 
processes which are implemented in a software project. It is a 
worthwhile goal to automatically transform at least parts of 
UML diagrams into software. Automated code generation reduces the 
total amount of errors in a software project but the model itself 
can still violate specified requirements. A quality improvement is 
the usage of a model checker which searches through the whole state 
space of model and checks whether all requirements are met. A model 
checker requires a formal description of a model for a complete 
verification. Activity diagrams often describe processes informally 
which is difficult to verify with a model checker. We therefore 
propose the transformation of activity to statechart diagrams which 
allow a more detailed and formal description. Several algorithms 
exist to map UML statecharts into a model checker input language 
for a successful formal verification. Afterwards, the model checker 
searches through the whole state space of a statechart and therefore 
has to store each state in memory. UML statecharts can reach a high 
degree of complexity which is problematic for a complete state space 
traversal because the total amount of available memory is exhausted. 
Accordingly, we present the domain specific language UDL (UML 
Statechart Modeling Language) and a transformation from UDL into the 
Spin model checker input language Promela. UDL contains features for 
property preserving abstraction which reduces the models state space 
and therefore the memory consumption of a model checker. Furthermore, 
we introduce an optimisation technique for the transformation process 
from UDL to Promela which focuses on a reduced model checker run-time. 
A case study with a movement tracking system demonstrates how our 
approach could significantly reduce the memory consumption of a model 
checker and allows the verification of complex models.},

systems large scale e-commerce systems and their interactions are hard 
to be validated or verified although the quality requirements for these 
systems are very high. The question is now: are there any further 
possibilities to check these systems except doing this manually?
   An approach is to focus on the models describing the systems; and 
specifically to focus on the models of the behavior. Although the 
verification of temporal aspects is much more complex than checking 
static dependencies there is a promising technology: model checking. 
Nevertheless we need distinctive improvements before this technology 
can be applied in the real system development. We need graphical formal 
requirement notations for different kinds of process model notations as 
representations of the specification of rules. We must be able to 
present the results positive and especially negative to the different 
types of stakeholders. And finally the model checking technique has to 
be improved in order to deal with different types of model elements 
which are typical for business process models.},

   abstract  = {Business process management (BPM) as a paradigm for 
enterprise planning and governance is nowadays a core discipline of 
information systems management. Growing up from the first process 
re-engineering initiatives in the 1980's, BPM technologies now seek 
to span all of the organizational silos of enterprises, and also expand 
vertically from the strategy layers where visions and goals are defined 
to the lower data transaction layers.  Ensuring the compliance of 
processes to the guidance and control provided to the business by 
regulations is an obligation to every enterprise. 
In this work, we motivate the need for automation in compliance 
management and propose the use of policies as a modeling concept for 
regulations. We introduce the CASE model for structuring regulatory 
compliance requirements as policies. Policies shall allow to model 
regulations at abstraction levels adequate to implementing platform 
independent mechanisms for policy verification. We describe the 
CASE model and explain how it can be used to structure and model 
policies extracted from regulations. This chapter also defines a 
policy modeling ontology that we propose as a language for formally 
modeling CASE policies. The basic CASE model and the corresponding 
policy modeling ontology support compliance of enterprise processes 
to regulations by enabling automation to compliance checking 
(verification). The utilization of the CASE method as well as the 
policy ontology is showcased using an example of resource access 
control in business processes.},

   abstract    = {System quality is a key issue in modern systems development. 
Tool support is essential for checking the system quality efficiently. This is 
particularly true with respect to the dynamic interactions of the processes within 
a system. A first generation of checkers - model checkers - provide a basic technology 
for the verification of process-based systems.
Conventional model checkers bear two drawbacks concerning mainly their user-friendliness 
which impede their broad application. First, model checkers in general do not support 
the graphical representation of rules (specifications). Although a model may be 
described with a graphical notation the specification which has to be checked against 
the model is generally still text-based. This makes the usage of the checker difficult 
for process modeling experts. Second, the expressiveness concerning the verification 
model semantics to be checked is limited to states which are connected by transitions. 
However, many system development models (e.g. the business process model we use as 
example) embrace more element types. These are unsupported by the conventional model 
checkers resulting in a loss of verification precision.
The checking system we present in this paper integrates both novelties: the graphical 
notation for a user-friendly specification and an extended specification language 
together with a corresponding verifier which supports the checking of many different 
types of elements (although the paper presents the approach with only two types). 
The integration is realized by an XML-based transformation system which links the 
graphical editor to the checking tool.},

% In a business process-oriented enterprise, controlling enterprise behaviour 
% is all about governing processes. Business process management (BPM) develops into a new 
% paradigm for enterprise computing which is nearer to business layers, and its semantic 
% variant (SBPM) promises more ease of integration and machine process ability.% Ensuring that business processes really fulfil business requirements becomes thus a 
% critical aspect. 
% This paper motivates the need for requirement engineering (RE) techniques in the field 
% of semantic business process management and puts the emphasis on one of the strategic 
% aspects of this task, being as policy management. In such techniques, requirements are 
% used as inception assets to help produce business process models. 
% We develop a requirements engineering technique, in the scope of the SUPER platform for 
% SBPM, which extends the Formal Tropos (FT) framework for goal-oriented requirement 
% engineering (GORE) with policy modelling capabilities. 
% The proposed technique is also illustrated using an industrial real-world example.

systems has been gaining a lot of attention in the recent past. It is imperative 
for a hard real-time embedded system to execute and respond to sequenced 
exchanges of messages under critical temporal constraints. The UML provides 
artifacts such as communication diagrams, sequence diagrams and timing diagrams 
to aid software engineers to model and precisely document such a schedule of 
interactions or state changes at the design level. While modeling at the design 
level is interesting on one hand, it is also significant to understand the 
run time behavior of the embedded software. A step forward in this direction is 
to provide a real-time representation of the target system behavior on the 
host side. We propose an approach to realize a target debugger on the host side 
with a monitor solution in the target side. With the back annotated information 
from the target, a visual representation of the system behavior in real-time is 
now available at the design level. This way, a debugging solution in real-time 
is provided, thus taking a step forward towards understanding the behavior of 
the embedded software at hand. We illustrate our proposed approach with a 
prototype and examples.},

However, deploying/executing these test cases in the embedded target without 
affecting the real-time behavior of the system still remains a challenging and 
unanswered question. To address this, we propose a novel architecture to 
perform an integrated model based testing for embedded systems. 
We introduce a holistic model based design, development and testing approach 
with the aid of a monitor and target debugger solution for real-time embedded 
systems. Our proposed approach eliminates the need for dynamic source code 
instrumentation inserted into the target to execute the software test routines.
This will result in preserving the real-time behavior which is a boon 
especially for real-time critical and code size constrained embedded systems.

the dynamic activities of a system. Therefore, it is of high interest to 
validate these models. Many kinds of (business) rules, best practices, 
patterns, legal regulations may serve as specifications which the models have 
to fulfill. An already established technique to validate models of dynamic 
activities is model checking. In model checking the requirements are expressed 
by temporal logic. Temporal logic allows describing temporal dependencies. 
The models to be verified by model checkers are automata. In this context the 
question is how to transform process or workflow models into automata and how 
to specify the temporal logic in the way that the semantic of the process 
models is considered sufficiently. In our paper we present three approaches to 
transform process models to checkable automata. We use the example of ARIS 
Event-driven Process Chains. In particular, the third approach introduces 
specializers enabling semantic-rich requirement specifications. This reduces 
the gap between process models (consisting of different model element types) 
and verification models.},

process management (BPM) as this paradigm is getting adopted more widely for designing

different levels of a BPM framework, which also includes the service layer. In this 
paper, we discuss requirements and methods for modeling contractual compliance for a 
SOA-supported BPM. We also show how business rule management integrated into an industry 
BPM tool allows modeling and processing functional and non-functional-property 
constraints which may be extracted from business process contracts. This work proposes 
a framework that responds to the requirements identified and proposes an architecture 
implementing it. Our approach is also illustrated by an example.}

transformations play an increasing role. To ease and automate these transformations, 
we propose a solution based on the operator hierarchy concept. It allows to define 
transformation operator hierarchies containing different levels of transformation 
operators. The operators capture reusable knowledge units. 
The concrete realization of such a higher-level transformation language construction 
is demonstrated by an application of the XML operator hierarchy concept to the 
transformation language XSLT. XSLT serves as an example which is employed to provide 
the elementary transformation operators. On top of these elementary operators the 
layered concept allows the definition of new higher-level operators, e. g. 
domain-independent and domain-specific ones. In an application example the construction 
of the higher-level language XML2DSV is presented. This is a stand-alone domain-specific 
transformation language, which can be used to create delimiter-separated values (DSV) 
files from XML documents, on the base of XSLT. 
We developed XTC (XML Transformation Coordinator) to automate the multi-level 
transformation process.},

   abstract    = {The automated generation of systems (e.g. within model-driven 
development) is a considerable improvement of the software development.
However, besides the automated generation the verification of these generated systems 
needs to be supported, too. By applying generators it is not necessarily guaranteed 
that the generation outcome is correct. Typical problems may be, firstly, the use of 
a wrong operator resulting in an erroneous generation (static aspects of the generation). 
Secondly, the interactions between the different generated system assets (snippets) of 
the generated outcome might be incorrect, since the snippets might be connected in a 
wrong sequence (dynamic aspect of the generation). Therefore, the hierarchical 
dependencies of the snippets which are the input of the generator as well as the dynamic 
behavior resulting from the generation have to be checked. 
We describe the hierarchy in a version model based on Boolean logic. The temporal 
behavior may be checked by model checkers. For the generation we apply our XOpT concept 
which provides domain-specific transformation operators on the XML representation. 
Besides the principles of the static and dynamic elements of our checking approach the 
paper presents the way to map program assets to the version model and to finite state 
automata which are the prerequisite for the checking.
Though the proposed checking is presented at the code level the approach may be applied 
to different kinds of assets, e.g. also on the model level.},

software developers. Such models help to gather requirements and to build a system 
implementing these requirements. However, it is often neglected to verify that the 
requirements are actually fulfilled in the design and implementation. The increasing 
demand for compliancy to requirements (e.g. due to laws) together with the increasing 
system complexity re-attracts notice to automatic verification technologies for that 
purpose. The low user-friendliness and, thus, the low applicability of the verification 
technologies often prevents their employment. In this paper we aim at closing the gap 
between software development models with their rich notation and semantics (e.g. Event 
Process Chains, EPCs) on the one hand and verification-oriented models (typically just 
simple structures like finite state automata) on the other hand. This is approached by 
extending the verification model in a controlled manner towards more semantics resulting 
in our extended Kripke structure. To profit from such a semantic extension we, in 
addition, extend the temporal logic language CTL. Our new temporal logic language allows 
to express the expected requirements more precisely.},

the dynamic behavior of a system. The dynamic aspects are the business processes and 
their models.
Whereas the static relations in a system may be expressed by Boolean logic, the dynamic 
activities and their temporal sequences ask for a better formalism, e.g. temporal logic. 
Temporal logic is based on Boolean logic extended by operators expressing the temporal 
order of states. In general there are different technologies to verify temporal 
sequences. Our choice is the model checking concept.
In the paper we present examples of business process models and how these models may be 
checked. We introduce a model to specify the rules (rules model) and demonstrate how 
the results of the checks can be displayed in the business process models. These models 
and the rules are represented in a graphical editor. Both models are transformed into a 
formal language which may be processed by a verification tool - a model checker in our 
case. The results are then visualized in the graphical editor indicating where the 
model violates or keeps the rules.},

engineering lifecycle. However, even though years of research have gone into seeking 
machine support for requirements engineering, the methods used are still highly manual 
and the vision of automatic transfer of business analysis requirements into IT systems 
supporting the business is still far from reach. On the other hand, incepting knowledge 
for creating AS-IS business processes in enterprise models has been recognized as a hard 
problem. In the context of a process centric organization, we propose an approach to 
create AS-IS business process models by automatically transferring requirements to the 
business process layer. Our aim is to enable carrying business requirements, goals and 
policies from an inception layer to the operational business process management layer. 
We place our research in the context of a semantic business process management platform 
(SUPER) as the support to exploit the output of our research. This paper grounds this 
research work and proposes a research design for requirement elicitation for producing 
early-phase business process models that are nearer to the business analysis layer.},

factor in this domain as the market requires a fast reaction to frequent changes in the

different services which are offered and hosted by different vendors which results in a 
complex integration problem.
Our proposed solution is based on the operator hierarchy concept which allows to define 
transformation operator hierarchies containing different levels of transformation 
operators. The concrete realization of such a higher-level transformation language 
construction is demonstrated by an application of the XML operator hierarchy concept to 
the transformation language XSLT. XSLT serves as an example which is employed to provide 
the elementary transformation operators. On top of these elementary operators the layered 
concept allows the definition of new higher-level operators, e. g. domain-independent and 
domain-specific ones. The construction of the higher-level language XML2DSV is presented, 
for instance. This is a stand-alone domain-specific transformation language, which 
creates delimeter-separated values (DSV) files from XML documents, on the base of XSLT.},

storing and exchanging of a wide variety of data. As a result, transformations between 
XML documents become more and more important. A scalable transformation approach requires 
the possibility to express transformation definitions in terms of domain-specific 
constructs. Only in this case, the domain knowledge is explicitly available and not 
hidden into, e. g., Java or XSLT code. Consequently, domain experts can easier 
understand, validate, and modify the transformation themselves.
This paper presents a generic composition concept that relies on transformation itself. 
It allows the definition of transformation operator hierarchies containing different 
levels of transformation operators, e. g. domain-independent and domain-specific ones. 
We apply the proposed operator hierarchy concept to XSLT, and build new complex operators 
on top of existing ones which are specifically suited to develop transformations in a

DEMOCLES -- that realizes a hybrid approach to platform-independent modeling. 
It describes the static structure using a modified UML class diagram that separates 
query operations from modifier operations. The former are defined in the class diagram 
via OCL constraints, while the latter are defined using a MOF-based metamodel that 
contains modifier operations and properties as first-class entities and augments them 
with associations and OCL expressions. The tool is an Eclipse-plugin that offers overlay 
views of the structure and behavior with visual editing capabilities and permits 
execution of a platform-independent system.},

both on the same and different levels of abstraction. This supports the stepwise
refinement, the dealing with the inherent complexity and allows the tailored 
documentation and specification of the different aspects of the system.
This paper presents the XOpT approach to support the composition and adaptation step.
It provides a framework based on XML, DOM and XPath technology with an hierarchy of 
transformation operators.
These are either generic or specifically suited for (and thus also restricted to) a 
certain domain. New operators may be added on top of existing ones on demand.
XOpT is a unification of composition and weaving techniques as it operates on the 
standardized XML data format. Furthermore, this language independence allows the
manipulations on different abstraction levels in parallel preserving model consistency.
The concepts have been applied to an e-commerce system based on ARIS which also serves 
as example in this paper.},

In this paper we introduce an approach to validating component compositions and showing 
how such a process can be supported by tools. We introduce a way to compare the 
interface specification of components automatically against the code. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate how compositions of components can be specified by logical formulas, 
allowing us to automatically validate these compositions.}

concepts in order to improve the software development and reuse have been introduced. 
Some of them like frameworks or components aim on the reuse of code others capture 
experiences with system architecture, design or coding recommendations.
This paper focuses on a way to express the reuse of pieces of software and design 
reasoning. We apply versions in order to describe sets of features we want to have in 
a system. Conditions are used to formulate these requirements. 
Then these conditions are integrated into UML models using the existing mechanisms for 
extensions. This enables a tight integration of versions and modeling constructs and 
enhances integrity of models.
The use of version is demonstrated by an example from the eCommerce domain. 
This paper also discusses the effects of the integration of version into UML models.},

The Workshop web page may be found at 
URL: http://www.info.uni-karlsruhe.de/~pulvermu/workshops/aosd2002/
Modularisation as a means to achieve separation of concerns is a key concept in the 
development of complex software. A fundamental goal is the independent specification of 
system aspects and their subsequent integration. 
There have been several novel approaches which try to find new dimensions for separation 
of concerns beyond the "traditional" concepts of module and class. For examples of such 
"advanced separation of concerns" we cite Adaptive Programming, Aspect-Oriented 
Programming, Composition Filters, Hyperspaces, role modeling, Subject-Oriented 
Programming, and so on. Recently such approaches have been subsumed under the umbrella 
term Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), whose themes, in addition to 
programming language extensions, also encompass enhancements of traditional analysis and 
design methodologies. Such a new and emerging field has yet to garner a uniform 
conception of its scope and a definition of its central terms. 
After the success of the first workshop by the GI on this topic, and in the run-up to 
the 1st International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development (April, 23-26, 
2002), the aim of this workshop is again to provide room for fruitful discussions among 
various academic and industrial working groups who are involved with issues of 
aspect-oriented software development and related themes. 
We have accepted 11 papers for this year's workshop whose topics cover a broad range 
from theoretical reasoning about aspect-oriented systems to practical applications 
thereof. They are all included in this technical report. },

    abstract = {This volume contains the Proceedings of the First Workshop on Software 
Composition (SC 2002). The Workshop has been held in Grenoble, France on April 7th, 2001, 
as a satellite event of ETAPS 2002. The aim of the SC Workshop is to collect different 
approaches and experiences in the domain of software composition.
Component-based approaches to produce software from smaller units attract increasing 
attention of both research and industry. The rational behind this trend is in the promise 
of reuse. This is the idea to produce software by "plug \& play" components which already
exist or are produced by different external vendors. Components and software composition 
are considered to be a new way to overcome the remaining problems (e.g. reusability, 
deal with complexity) still not solved by the object-oriented paradigm.
In this context, the SC workshop collects different approaches and experiences to explore 
and overcome the gap between promise and reality. 
The goal is to demystify these new approaches based on components and instead elaborate 
the real advantages, problems and challenges.},

   abstract  = {Software reuse usually has the drawback that the documentation of the 
software units is rather incomplete and inaccurate. It is hard to verify that such a 
component offers both the required and promised features / behavior.
In this paper we present an approach to describe the components' features and dynamic 
behavior as finite state machines which may automatically be verified by model checkers.
The model of the component is derived from the code providing consistency between 
documentation and implementation. The models of several components may be combined to 
larger systems (according to the composition of the real code components).
To deal with the state explosion problem, our approach allows to "abstract" of the 
complete component's behavior as needed (compression and inflation).
In the beginning of a reuse-based system development the requirements are modeled 
similarly as the reusable code assets. 
Model checking can be employed to determine the consistency between these requirement 
models and the models of the complete systems, subsystems or components. The tool 
support eases incremental system development and rapid prototyping / checking. 
The impact of a composed component (the component's model respectively) may be instantly 
examined (against the modeled requirements).}

dependencies between them become vast and tangling. This results in the necessity of an 
improved management of the dependencies

model component composition and to validate them. We apply the component model based on 
the interface description with InPorts and OutPorts which allow a rather detailed 
definition of the components interaction. Moreover we take the term feature to name the 
core requirements to a component. Features are used to drive the description of the 
component composition which is regarded as an combination of features expressed by
logical operators. Moreover the InPorts and OutPorts describe the dynamic component 
interactions. The combination of OutPorts and InPorts according to the component 
composition rules allows to reason about the component system's dynamic behavior.},

observation that the knowledge about inter-object collaborations cannot be localised 
within objects but cross-cuts many objects. Such cross-cutting concerns are effectively 
addressed by applying the separation of concerns principle. We have, therefore, employed 
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to build collaboration-based designs.
In the paper we illustrate and discuss our aspect-oriented approach both for the 
horizontal (i.e. the collaborations) and vertical (i.e. the refinements) dimensions.
Although the example implementations are based on AspectJ0.4beta7 from Xerox PARC, the 
approach is generic enough to be implemented using other AOP techniques.},

Existing evolution approaches are committed to a particular instance
adaptation strategy. This is because changes to the instance adaptation
strategy or an attempt to adopt an entirely different strategy would be very
costly. This paper proposes a flexible instance adaptation approach for
systems employing class versioning to manage evolution. Flexibility is
achieved by encapsulating the instance adaptation code in aspects -
abstractions introduced by aspect-oriented programming to localise
cross-cutting concerns.  This makes it possible to make cost-effective
changes to the instance adaptation strategy. The flexibility of the approach
is demonstrated by using two instance adaptation strategies: error handlers
and update/backdate methods.},

programming aiming at a better separation of concerns. Cross-cutting code is captured

   abstract  = {We illustrate how to combine CORBA as a distributed system with 
aspect-oriented programming (AOP) and the resulting positive impacts.
In particular, we focus on the question how AOP can be applied to a CORBA application 
aiming at a better separation of concerns.
The paper shows with implementation examples a practical way to package the distribution 
issues of a CORBA application into separated aspects (with AspectJ).
This supports the distributed application design and leads to increased flexiblity.},
