  abstract	= {The existing model-based tools employ runtime monitoring
		  methodologies for debugging and testing of embedded
		  systems. In these tools, the additional instrumentation for
		  incorporating and executing the test code varies based on
		  the application. Such techniques could also introduce
		  significant, non-deterministic overhead in the embedded
		  system. This is a hurdle in applying Model-Based Testing
		  (MBT) for resource constrained embedded systems and
		  industrially relevant examples. To address this gap, this
		  paper elaborates on the monitoring methodology used in a
		  test framework for executing the model-based test cases in
		  the embedded system. Two variants of the proposed
		  monitoring methodology, (a) software and (b) on-chip
		  monitoring are discussed. An empirical evaluation based on
		  a prototype implementation of the proposed runtime
		  monitoring mechanisms is discussed. },

		  services can be used to derive functional test cases to
		  test services in a sandbox environment. In the first step
		  the description of the service is used to generate a
		  state-based model of the service behaviour and its
		  interfaces. Therefore, a methodology to enrich service
		  descriptions for (semi-) automated test derivation and the
		  required IoT specific adaptations are shown. These
		  descriptions are used to generate customised test data and
		  to achieve full parameter combination coverage. In the
		  second step the generated extended finite state machine
		  model is analysed to create test cases in a standardised
		  testing notation. Utilising this two-step automation
		  approach enables test developers to evaluate and influence
		  resulting test cases. The implementation proves that the
		  envisaged extension can amplify the usefulness of web
		  services descriptions for the test derivation for IoT

		  modules based on individual boundary conditions for

		  university can share the same repertoire of modules.
		  Furthermore, the industry benefits from up to date

		  model-based paradigm to support the complexity of todayâ€™s
		  embedded systems, as they become more and more important
		  and omnipresent in our daily lives. In this context, the
		  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a widely used standard.
		  Code generators can be executed to generate source code
		  from UML models. Usually the code generators are
		  proprietary for one UML tool. If code generators for
		  different targets or programming languages have to be
		  supported by various modeling tools, the wheel must be
		  reinvented. Code generators could use the standardized
		  Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI)
		  format of the UML as a basis. However, tools export their
		  data to XMI differently. Therefore, the paper shows how the
		  proprietary models of UML tools can be mapped to a
		  standardized UML model. This is realized by using
		  techniques for model to model transformations. These
		  techniques need a meta-model for the source and the target
		  model. Hence, an approach is introduced for creating
		  meta-models for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
		  of UML-tools, which act as a facade. Then the code
		  generators can work with the standardized UML model to
		  generate the source code. This results in an improved
		  scalability of the code generators.},
