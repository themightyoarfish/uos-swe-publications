  abstract	= {Embedded software engineering very often involves
		  development of complex, mission critical software; wherein
		  it is imperative that the developed software fulfills its
		  requirements to achieve high quality. In such cases, there
		  are several advantages of using specialized Requirements
		  Management (RM) tools for managing the requirements.
		  Critical timing requirements are among the foremost
		  non-functional (quality) requirements to be fulfilled by
		  increasingly complex embedded software. Further, a correct
		  and effective timing behavior is among the characteristics
		  of high-quality software. On the other hand, Model-Driven
		  Development (MDD) is considered as the next paradigm shift
		  to address the increasing complexity in embedded software
		  development and to achieve high-quality standards.
		  Similarly, there are specialized tools for validating and
		  analyzing the timing behavior of the embedded software.
		  However, such tools are used very late in the development
		  process, when the actual timing errors occur. Thus, it is
		  intuitive to perceive that an integrated model-based
		  framework encompassing a complete workflow from
		  specification until validation of timing requirements in
		  embedded software systems is very beneficial for
		  high-quality software development, nevertheless is still
		  missing. Addressing the aforementioned gap, this paper
		  proposes an approach toward a complete workflow for
		  managing timing requirements in RM tools, specifying timing
		  behavior in MDD tools and their validation in specialized
		  tools for timing analyses. A prototype implementation of
		  the proposed framework and its experimental evaluation are
		  discussed.},
